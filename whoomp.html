        <p>
            "Whoomp! (There It Is)" is the debut single by 1990s rap duo Tag Team, written by members Cecil "DC the Brain Supreme" Glenn and Steve "Rolln" 
            Gibson. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B chart and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1993. "Whoomp!" reached multi-platinum
            status and broke records for the number of consecutive weeks in the top 10. Though Tag Team is considered a one-hit wonder, as their subsequent 
            singles did not find the same success, "Whoomp!" has remained a pop culture staple with multiple placements in film, television, and advertisements.
            The song has also endured as a mainstay at sporting and arena events. Tag Team recorded "Whoomp! (There It Is)" in August 1992. At that time, Glenn
            was working as the main DJ at Magic City, an Atlanta gentlemen's club that would later become recognized as a hub of Atlanta hip-hop and rap music. 
            The song sampled a synthesizer line from the 1980 Italo disco hit "I'm Ready" by Kano. Glenn played the track in the club on the same day it was 
            mixed and received a positive reaction from the audience. In the following months, people requested the song so often that it became clear the song
            had the potential to become a hit. The single was shopped to and rejected by multiple record labels because executives were unfamiliar with southern
            bass and were unsure if the sound would sell well around the country. Glenn instead borrowed $2,500 from his parents to press eight hundred records.
            The singles quickly sold out in Atlanta on word of mouth alone.
