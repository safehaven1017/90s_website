        <p>
            "Ice Ice Baby" is a hip hop song by American rapper Vanilla Ice, and DJ Earthquake. It was based on the bassline of "Under Pressure" 
            by British rock band Queen and British singer David Bowie, who did not receive songwriting credit or royalties until after it had become 
            a hit. Robert Van Winkle, better known by his stage name Vanilla Ice, wrote "Ice Ice Baby" in 1983 at the age of 16, basing its lyrics 
            upon his experiences in South Florida. The lyrics describe a shooting and Van Winkle's rhyming skills. The chorus of "Ice Ice Baby" 
            also originates from the signature chant of the national African American fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha.
