        <p>
            "2 Legit 2 Quit" is a song by Hammer featuring Saja (a.k.a. Sonia Moore), released on September 5, 1991 as the first single from his 
            fourth studio album, Too Legit to Quit (1991). At the end of the "2 Legit 2 Quit" music video, after James Brown enlists Hammer to obtain 
            the glove of Michael Jackson, a silver-white sequined glove is shown on the hand of a Jackson look-alike doing the "2 Legit 2 Quit" hand 
            gesture. It was a reference to Hammer wanting to challenge Jackson to a dance-off for rights to his famous glove, which is also referenced 
            on the album. Hammer and Jackson would later appear, speak and perform at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006. M.C. Hammer appeared 
            on The Wendy Williams Show on July 27, 2009 and told a story about a phone call he received from Michael Jackson, regarding the portion of 
            the "2 Legit 2 Quit" video that included a fake Jackson, giving his approval and inclusion of it. He explained how Jackson had seen the video 
            and liked it, and both expressed they were a fan of each other.
